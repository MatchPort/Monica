## Installation 🌟

Download the latest release, extract it and open `Monica.exe`!


    
## Usage ⭐

After opening monica you can use the built in .monica builder. To use our built in builder click 2 on the main screen.

To build your own .monica file simply just create a new file with the schema: `Name.Monica` and fill the file with urls!
## Troubleshooting 💫

Incase the file doesn't run please make sure you have dotnet installed.
## Future Updates 🌠

Monica will be updated with a fiddler / tencer type of proxy server that redirects chosen urls to a new url
